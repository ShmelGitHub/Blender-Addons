I made a script 1 with the assistance of ChatGPT :rofl:. It adds a button on RMB panel called ‘Auto Smooth’. Each time when pressed it adds a new modifier to the object if not exists and send it to the bottom of the modifier list. The problem with sharing data is not solved tho(
Enough for me, at least for now. Maybe this script will help someone
